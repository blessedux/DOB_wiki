# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ addresses common questions about DOB Protocol, DePIN financing, and revenue tokenization.

## General Questions

### What is DOB Protocol?

DOB Protocol is a platform that enables the creation of trustless business models powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), where participants in collaborative value creation receive direct ownership of digital assets and their generated benefits. Our platform tokenizes future revenues from DePIN devices, allowing investors to own a share of their earnings.

### What does DePIN stand for?

DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. These are networks of physical devices that provide real-world services while being coordinated and incentivized through blockchain technology.

### What types of DePIN devices can use DOB Protocol?

DOB Protocol supports a wide range of DePIN device types, including:

- Compute nodes (servers, mining rigs, validators)
- Energy generation devices (solar panels, wind turbines)
- Network infrastructure (5G nodes, WiFi hotspots)
- Sensors and IoT devices
- Data storage devices

### How does DOB Protocol make money?

DOB Protocol charges a small platform fee (typically 5%) on revenue distributions. This fee helps maintain the platform, fund development, and provide insurance against potential losses.

## Tokenization

### What is revenue tokenization?

Revenue tokenization is the process of converting future revenue streams from physical assets into tradable digital tokens. These tokens represent a claim on a portion of the revenue generated by the underlying asset.

### How does tokenization benefit device owners?

Device owners can access upfront capital by selling tokens representing future revenue, essentially getting paid today for tomorrow's earnings. This enables expansion without traditional financing, while maintaining partial ownership of the revenue stream.

### How does tokenization benefit investors?

Investors gain access to DePIN infrastructure revenue streams that were previously inaccessible. They can create diversified portfolios of revenue-generating assets with various risk profiles and returns, all with the liquidity advantages of tokenized assets.

### What percentage of revenue can be tokenized?

Most device owners tokenize between 50-80% of their device revenue. The rest remains with the device owner to cover maintenance, operation costs, and profit margin.

## Technical Questions

### How does DOB Protocol ensure revenue reporting is accurate?

DOB Protocol uses a combination of AI agents, hardware-based attestation mechanisms, and cross-validation with external data sources to verify the accuracy of reported revenues. Any discrepancies trigger additional verification steps before distribution.

### What blockchains does DOB Protocol support?

DOB Protocol is blockchain-agnostic and supports multiple chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and others. The choice of blockchain depends on factors like gas costs, transaction speed, and ecosystem integration.

### Is DOB Protocol decentralized?

DOB Protocol operates with a hybrid model that combines on-chain and off-chain components. Key functions like token issuance, revenue distribution, and governance happen on-chain, while data processing, validation, and API services operate off-chain for efficiency.

### How secure is DOB Protocol?

DOB Protocol employs multiple security layers:

- Secure hardware enclaves for sensitive operations
- Multi-signature authorization for critical functions
- Regular security audits by third-party firms
- Insurance coverage for potential losses
- Open-source code with bug bounty programs

## Integration and Usage

### How difficult is it to integrate my devices with DOB Protocol?

Integration complexity depends on your device type, but DOB Protocol is designed to be as simple as possible. Most standard devices can be integrated within hours using our installation scripts and configuration guides.

### What are the minimum requirements for a device to use DOB Protocol?

Devices must meet these minimum requirements:

- Internet connectivity
- Ability to run the DOB Agent software
- Verifiable revenue generation
- Operational history of at least 30 days (for tokenization)

### Can I use DOB Protocol for non-crypto revenue sources?

Yes, DOB Protocol can tokenize traditional revenue sources if they can be reliably reported and verified. Examples include subscription fees, service revenues, and usage-based income.

## Economic Questions

### What are typical returns for tokenized devices?

Returns vary widely based on device type, market conditions, and operational efficiency. Typical annual yields range from:

- Compute Nodes: 10-25%
- Energy Nodes: 8-15%
- Network Nodes: 12-30%
- Data Storage: 15-40%

These figures are historical averages and not guarantees of future performance.

### How are token prices determined?

Token prices are initially set during the tokenization process based on projected revenues and desired yield. After initial distribution, market forces determine token prices based on:

- Actual revenue performance
- Market supply and demand
- Investor sentiment
- Comparable asset yields

### Is revenue tokenization subject to securities regulations?

Regulatory treatment varies by jurisdiction. DOB Protocol provides compliance tools and guidance, but device owners should consult legal experts in their jurisdiction for specific advice.
