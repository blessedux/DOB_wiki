# Introduction to DOB Protocol

DOB Protocol is building the financial backbone for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) by enabling on-chain financing for autonomous machines. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the DOB Protocol platform, its components, and how to integrate with it.

## What is DOB Protocol?

DOB is a platform that enables the creation of trustless business models powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), where participants in collaborative value creation receive direct ownership of digital assets and their generated benefits.

The protocol tokenizes future revenues from DePIN devices—such as wireless networks, compute infrastructure, and energy nodes—allowing investors to own a share of their earnings. Through AI-driven agents, DOB automates validation, revenue distribution, and risk assessment, ensuring that tokenized revenues can be used as collateral for financing.

## The DePIN Opportunity

The DePIN market is set to grow by 59% in just five years, surging from $2.2 trillion in 2023 to $3.5 trillion by 2028. Despite this exponential growth, financing mechanisms for DePIN remain nearly nonexistent. DOB Protocol is seizing this first-mover opportunity to build the financial rails for the next decade of machine-driven economies.

## Core Components

DOB Protocol consists of several key components:

1. **AI Agents Framework**: A plugin for the Virtuals.io game framework that enables Real-World Asset (RWA) AI agents
2. **Hardware Implementation**: Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) run AI agents that manage RWA and DePIN devices
3. **Revenue Distribution System**: Ensures fair distribution of yield and revenue from DePIN devices
4. **Liquidity Management**: Stabilizes token flow through liquidity pools
5. **Undercollateralized Lending**: Enables secure business financing for DePIN infrastructure expansion
