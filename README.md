# DOB Protocol Documentation Wiki

## Overview

DOB Protocol is building the financial backbone for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) by enabling on-chain financing for autonomous machines. This documentation wiki serves as the comprehensive knowledge base for developers, investors, and users interested in the DOB ecosystem.

## About DOB Protocol

DOB is a platform that enables the creation of trustless business models powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), where participants in collaborative value creation receive direct ownership of digital assets and their generated benefits.

The protocol tokenizes future revenues from DePIN devices—such as wireless networks, compute infrastructure, and energy nodes—allowing investors to own a share of their earnings. Through AI-driven agents, DOB automates validation, revenue distribution, and risk assessment, ensuring that tokenized revenues can be used as collateral for financing.

## Key Components

- **AI Agents Framework**: Plugin for Virtuals.io game framework enabling RWA AI agents
- **Hardware Implementation**: TEE-run AI agents that manage RWA and DePIN devices
- **Revenue Distribution System**: Ensures fair distribution of yield and revenue
- **Liquidity Management**: Stabilizes token flow through liquidity pools
- **Undercollateralized Lending**: Enables secure business financing for DePIN infrastructure

## Market Opportunity

The DePIN market is set to grow by 59% in just five years, surging from $2.2 trillion in 2023 to $3.5 trillion by 2028. Despite this exponential growth, financing mechanisms for DePIN remain nearly nonexistent. DOB Protocol is seizing this first-mover opportunity to build the financial rails for the next decade of machine-driven economies.
